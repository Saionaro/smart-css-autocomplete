# Smart CSS Autocomplete

Autocomplete CSS properties smarter - using an usage statistics instead of standard random. SCA just gather you CSS props usage statistics to sort props on the right order.

## Attention

For better experience we suggest to switch VS Code parameter `Text Editor` - `Suggest Selection` to 'first' option.
In that case SCA will preselect the most used CSS property automatically.
